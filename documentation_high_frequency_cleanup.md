# CO2 Concentration Data Analysis

## Overview
This document serves as documentation for a Python script that analyzes monthly average CO2 concentration data. The analysis involves the use of Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to identify and remove high-frequency components from the raw data. The cleaned data is then visualized to compare with the original CO2 concentration trends.

## Requirements
- Python 3.10
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib

## Usage
1. **Clone or Download the Script:**
    - Clone the repository or download the Python script from the provided source.

2. **Install Dependencies:**
    - Ensure that the required Python libraries are installed by running the following command:
        ```bash
        pip install pandas numpy matplotlib
        ```

3. **Run the Script:**
    - Execute the Python script to perform the CO2 concentration analysis.

## Functionality

### Data Loading
The script starts by loading CO2 concentration data from a specified URL using the `load_data` function.

### Raw Data Plotting
The raw CO2 concentration data is plotted to provide a visual representation of the original trends over time.

### FFT and Frequency Analysis
The script applies Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to the raw data to obtain frequency domain information. This process includes calculating the time step and computing corresponding frequencies in cycles per month. The resulting frequency spectrum is plotted for analysis.

### High-Frequency Component Removal
High-frequency components are identified based on a specified threshold. These components are then zeroed out in the frequency domain, and the modified frequency spectrum is visualized.

### Inverse FFT and Cleaned Data Plotting
The script applies the inverse FFT to the modified frequency data, resulting in cleaned CO2 concentration data. The cleaned data, along with explicit time values on the x-axis, is plotted for comparison with the raw data.

### Display Plots
All plots, including the raw data, frequency spectrum, modified frequency spectrum, and cleaned data, are displayed for visual inspection.

## Conclusion
This script provides a comprehensive analysis of monthly average CO2 concentration data, encompassing data loading, visualization, frequency analysis, and the removal of high-frequency components. The resulting visualizations aid in understanding the impact of high-frequency noise on the CO2 concentration trends.
